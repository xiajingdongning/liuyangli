* What was the most interesting part of this project? *Building interactive web application and integrating 360-degree video is technically challenging. 
Acquiring accurate and high quality content (e.g., images, videos, and information) for different locations is also difficult as we did not find usable existing database.
But the most interesting part is creating that astonish 360 degree landing page.*
